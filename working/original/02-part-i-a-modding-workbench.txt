# Part I Building a Modding Workbench

![](images/Crafting_Table.png "")


## Overview
Welcome to the exciting world of Minecraft plugin development. In this first section of the book, I'll introduce you to the tools you'll need to start programming. In Minecraft, you need to first create a *workbench* (also sometimes called a *crafting table*) before you can craft more sophisticated tools. So too in real life you'll need to first gather some resources and setup a work area where you can create sophisticated Minecraft plugins. This part of the book describes the resources you'll need, how to get them, and how to set up your "modding workbench." All of the resource you'll need are freely available online. The ingredients you'll need to construct your modding workbench are as follows:

 * CraftBukkit: A freely available open source Minecraft server
 * ScriptCraft: A plugin for CraftBukkit
 * A text editor: gedit, TextWrangler, or any other text editor suitable for programming

The following chapters will show you how to install and set up each of these.
