# Chapter 4: Choosing and Using a Text Editor


Up to now you've been executing JavaScript at the server console window using the `js ` command. This is a perfectly good way to try JavaScript. It's nice to have a command-line interpreter when trying things out and exploring a new language. However, once you want to start doing some real work with JavaScript, you'll want to be able to save your work and run it, without issuing many `js` commands at the server console window each time your server starts. 

ScriptCraft lets you load JavaScript files you've saved and either can run them automatically when the server starts up or can run your code *on-demand*. If you plan on saving your work, you'll need to write your code using a text editor. Any text editor could do, but I strongly recommend using a text editor dedicated to programming. A programming text editor will have a few extra bells and whistles to make writing code easier than it would be in a plain old text editor like Notepad. Most programming editors have what's called *syntax highlighting*, which colors different parts of your code to make it easier to read. Compare Figure 4.1 from a regular text editor to Figure 4.2 from a programming editor.

I think you'll agree that the syntax highlighting in Figure 4.2 makes the code more pleasant to read. 

## Choosing an Editor

There are many programming editors to choose from. Which editor you choose is ultimately up to you. I've been using Emacs&mdash;an open source editor&mdash;for many years, but I don't recommend it to beginning programmers because while powerful, it takes some time to learn. Programmers get very attached to their programming editors after time. You should start with an editor that's easy to use and learn. In this chapter, I'll talk about gedit, but you can use any of the following programming editors to get started programming:

* Notepad++ is a free editor for Windows you can download at *http://notepad-plus-plus.org/*.
* TextWrangler from BareBones Software is a free editor for Mac OS X you can download at *www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/*.
* Sublime Text is a cross-platform editor that you can evaluate for free for as long as you like.

[AU: where do they get Sublime?]

Let's get started installing gedit. You can skip this section if you've already installed and use a programming editor on your computer. Mac OS users can skip the following section and go straight to "Installing TextWrangler on Mac OS."

## gedit

The editor I use for screenshots in this book is called gedit. I chose gedit for use in this book because:

* It is cross-platform: It runs on Windows and Linux. gedit also runs on older versions of Mac OS (up to version 10.5), but I recommend using TextWrangler for Mac OS.
* It is lightweight and easy to use. It installs quickly, doesn't take up much disk space, and doesn't have a whole lot of features you'll need to learn. It has just enough features to get started in programming.
* It has a Disk Explorer Pane, which shows the folders with which you'll be working. This can be really handy when you want to quickly browse the folders for files to edit.
* It is free to use. It won't cost you to download, and it won't nag you to upgrade to a paid version. 

You don't have to use gedit. Any programming editor will do. All programming editors have similar features; they let you create new files, edit, and save files. 

You can download gedit at *https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit/*. Follow the download instructions for your platform. 

### Installing gedit on Linux
If you use Linux, then gedit is probably already installed on your computer (click the Dash Home button in the top left of your Linux screen and type `gedit` to find it). If it's not already installed, you can install it by opening the Ubuntu Software Center application and searching for *gedit* or by issuing the following command in a Terminal window:

    sudo apt-get install gedit

Once installed, you can launch gedit by typing `gedit` into the Dash Home search window (click the Dash Home button).

### Installing gedit on Windows
Follow these steps to install gedit on Windows:

1. Open your browser and go to *https://wiki.gnome.rog/Apps/Gedit*.
2. Go to the Download section of the page and click the Windows Binaries link.
3. Click the link for the latest version (at the time of writing this is 2.30).
4. Click the `gedit-setup.exe` link (it might be called a slightly different name).
5. Once it's downloaded, open the `gedit-setup.exe` file to begin the install.
6. Follow all of the install wizard steps. You can use the default values.

Once installed, gedit should appear in your Start menu. If it doesn't appear in your Start menu, you can search for it by typing `gedit` in the Start menu's Search field. 

### The File Browser

Most modern programming editors provide a file browsing view where you can see&mdash;at a glance&mdash;all of your folders and files. The disk browser is super useful when you want to quickly navigate around your JavaScript folders and files. To enable the file browsing view in gedit, choose View > Side Panel to open the Side Panel view. In the bottom of the Side Panel view there is a File Browser tab that you should click to switch to the File Browser. From the File Browser (Disk Browser in TextWrangler on Mac OS), you can quickly open files, view folder contents, and create new files and subfolders (see Figure 4.3). Once you enable the Side Panel view, it will be displayed the next time you launch gedit.

### The gedit File Browser on Microsoft Windows
The first time you launch gedit for Windows, you will need to change one of the default settings so that all files and folders appear in the File Browser window. By default only folders are shown in the Windows File Browser. This isn't very useful because you'll want to work with folders and JavaScript files. To ensure you can see all types of files, do the following: In the File Browser window, right-click anywhere (click the right mouse button) and make sure that the Show Binary option is selected under the Filter menu. This will ensure all file types are visible (see Figure 4.4).

### gedit Preferences
The next step is to set some preferences for how the editor should behave. You do this by choosing Edit > Preferences to open the Preferences dialog (see Figure 4.5). Let's look at each of the preferences sections in turn.

[AUTHOR NOTE: images/chapter-04/screenshot-gedit-prefs-1.png]

![](images/chapter-04/screenshot-gedit-prefs-1.png)

<caption>Figure 4.5: View preferences</caption>

### View Preferences

It's useful to have gedit display line numbers alongside your code. The line numbers appear in the left margin of the window and are not part of your actual code. 
gedit will display a faint margin along the right side of the window in column 80. This margin is just a guide to indicate that perhaps your line of code is too long. It's only a guide, though, and can be safely ignored. It's generally considered good practice to keep lines of code shorter than 80 characters long to help readability, but there will always be exceptions to this rule.

The Enable Text Wrapping setting should be turned off for programming. It's useful if you're writing a letter, essay, or other nonprogramming text, but it can be confusing if turned on while programming. 

Highlight Current Line makes it easier to see where you currently are in the code. When looking at a large JavaScript file, it can be difficult to see the cursor (the blinking block that appears next to letters as you type).

Highlight Matching Brackets is a super useful programming feature. As you move the cursor around your JavaScript source, when the cursor is next to any of the following characters, it will match the opening or closing character.

* Round brackets: (  )
* Curly brackets: {  }
* Square brackets: [  ]

This can really help when writing or editing code. In Figure 4.6, you can see the cursor on line 1 next to the `{` character with both the opening and closing curly brackets highlighted in gray.

### Editor Preferences

Figure 4.7 shows the settings available on the Editor tab.

[AUTHOR NOTE: images/chapter-04/screenshot-gedit-prefs-2.png]

![](images/chapter-04/screenshot-gedit-prefs-2.png)

<caption>Figure 4.7: Editor preferences</caption>


I recommend using either two or four spaces for tabs to make your code more readable. This is largely a matter of style and personal taste. When starting out, you should probably use four spaces. 

Automatic Indentation is a handy feature that saves you having to type Tab and space characters when you start writing a new line of code.

gedit can create a backup of your files before you save them. This is usually a good idea.

### Fonts & Colors

Figure 4.8 shows the settings available on the Fonts & Colors tab.

[AUTHOR NOTE: images/chapter-04/screenshot-gedit-prefs-3.png]

![](images/chapter-04/screenshot-gedit-prefs-3.png)

<caption>Figure 4.8: Fonts & Colors preferences</caption>


You can change the font and color scheme to suit your own tastes. Some people prefer dark text on a light background, and some prefer light text on a dark background. Pick the color scheme you like. You can always change it later.

### Plugins

Figure 4.9 shows the settings available on the Plugins tab.

[AUTHOR NOTE: images/chapter-04/screenshot-gedit-prefs-4.png]

gedit comes with a couple of editing plugins. You should make sure that the File Browser Panel plugin is selected.

## Installing TextWrangler on Mac OS
Follow these steps to install TextWrangler on Mac OS:

1. Open the App Store application and search for *TextWrangler* in the search box in the top right.
2. Click the Free/Install App button to begin installing.

Once installed, you can launch TextWrangler by typing `textw` in the Spotlight search field in the top right of the screen and clicking the TextWrangler result.

Whenever you Launch TextWrangler, you should open a Disk Browser window by choosing File > New > Disk Browser. The Disk Browser in TextWrangler lets you quickly navigate around different files in the ScriptCraft folder and subfolders (see Figure 4.10). 

[AUTHOR NOTE: images/chapter-04/textwrangler-disk-browser.png]

![](images/chapter-04/textwrangler-disk-browser.png)

<caption>Figure 4.10: TextWrangler's Disk Browser</caption>


## First Steps with Your Editor

To get used to working with a programming editor, you're going to create a new folder and file in the ScriptCraft plugins folder and save the new file. 

### Create a New Folder

In the File Browser pane (the Disk Browser in TextWrangler on Mac OS), locate and select the folder where you installed CraftBukkit earlier. Then navigate to the `plugins/scriptcraft/plugins` subfolder. Once that folder is selected, right-click the folder and choose New Folder from the menu (see Figure 4.11). Call your new folder `learning` for now. You can call it something else as long as it's memorable&mdash;you'll come back to this folder later.

[AUTHOR NOTE: images/chapter-04/screenshot-edit-new-folder.png]

![](images/chapter-04/screenshot-edit-new-folder.png)

<caption>Figure 4.11: Creating a new folder</caption>


Your new folder will now appear in the File/Disk Browser pane. 

### Create a New JavaScript File

The next step is to create a new JavaScript file in the subfolder you just created. The file won't do much just yet, but you'll work some more on it soon. Right-click the folder you just created and choose New File from the menu (see Figure 4.12). Call the new file `helloWorld.js`.

[AUTHOR NOTE: images/chapter-04/screenshot-edit-new-file.png]

![](images/chapter-04/screenshot-edit-new-file.png)

<caption>Figure 4.12: Creating a new file</caption>


The file has just been created but hasn't been opened. If using TextWrangler, click the file to open it. If using gedit, double-click the file to open it. The file contents now appear in the editing pane on the right. The file is, as you'd expect, empty. Type in the following code exactly as you see it:

    // TO DO : Add some code later

The previous code is just a *comment* you've added to remind yourself that you must add some proper code later. This comment isn't understandable to the computer, so you can write whatever you like on a line beginning with `//`. The computer will not try to interpret and execute it. Comments like this can be useful for programmers because they make understanding code easier. Writing code is like any kind of writing&mdash;you should try to make your code readable by yourself and others, so if you look at your code later, you can figure out what you did. 

Most programming languages provide a way to add comments. In JavaScript there are different ways you can add comments. You can add a single-line comment like the one shown previously by inserting two forward slashes (`//`), and then any text after is a comment and will be ignored by the computer until the next line. I'll talk more about comments later. 

### Saving Your Work

Save the file by choosing Save from the File menu or by pressing Ctrl+S (Cmd+S on Mac OS). The file is now saved. You can verify this by closing the file and opening it once more. To close the file, choose File > Close or press the close icon next to the file name at the top of the editor pane.

Reopen the file by double-clicking it in the File/Disk Browser pane. The text you entered previously should still be present. Saving your work is really important because code you edit will not take effect unless you first save it. You'd be surprised how often even experienced programmers forget this simple rule and are left wondering why their code isn't working as expected.

When using ScriptCraft, the folder where you save your work is important. You can't just save your files anywhere and hope they'll be executed by ScriptCraft. For now you've saved the newly created `helloWorld.js` file in the `plugins/scriptcraft/plugins` subfolder. Just as the Minecraft server looks for `.jar` files in its `plugins` subfolder to load Java-based plugins, ScriptCraft too looks for `.js` files in its own `scriptcraft/plugins` folder to load JavaScript-based plugins.

## Summary

You've installed a programming editor and have taken your first steps creating and editing a new JavaScript file. In the next part of the book, you'll dive into creating working JavaScript plugins for Minecraft. 

This is where the fun begins.
